Artificial Life Simulator

Current Version v2

Changelog
v1 Simple Chasing (the mouse pointer)
v2 Flocking (herd like behaviour)

Controls and Parametrization
At this moment not a lot can be parameterized or controled. 
The First slider controls the herd size and the second slider controls targeting. 
{ Full -> Target = Mouse Pointer. Zero -> Target = Automatic (At this moment this moves target to center in future it will basically imply free will.) }

Future Plans
Energy, Hunger, Food Sources, Species, Predators, Map, Pathfinding, Traits, etc. 

This is a personal project that I work on when I get free time (mostly weekends or college holidays). If there is something that you would like to see in this simulator leave me a message at tapanranjan@gmail.com . Also to check out my various other projects visit www.tapanranjan.com
